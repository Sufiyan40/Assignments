      <p>On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years,
      I've contributed to many design systems that set a foundation
      for typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set
      a foundation and apply it to an emerging library of interface
      components. This article summarizes those patterns.</p>
      <p>Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families
      and weights along with fallbacks. It then explores how to
      build hierarchy using size, color, additional details like
      line-height, and layering responsiveness. Those models are
      then applied to components in a system's library (like
      Article and Header) as well as custom components made by
      other teams.</p>
